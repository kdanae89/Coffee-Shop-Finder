//So i set up my pseudocode to give you guys a somewhat smooth easy to follow build.

//declare angular

//create our controller, calling this one findShops
//name controller and http input for the function

//declare "this" globally within the function so that all http requests can grab
//set this equal to variable for use within the return of the http requests

//the first thing i want to do is 'GET' 'coffee shop/cafe' data within a specific radius of our input zip code

//this.getShops = function(zipcode)
//$http({............
// so: method = 'GET', url: 'url to our API




//.then
//     function(response)
//        log response         (so for now this section will be guesswork until i can get into our API and find what data im getting back. how the response will be formatted.)



//})
