Approach by user story:

User Stories
----------------------------------------------------------
On entering the website: A user will enter in the center point of their search by entering their zip code.

A user will be returned a list of coffee shops/cafes in order of distance.

A user will also have access to rating/review information of the shop.

A user should be able to see the TRENDING coffee shops based on algorithm: now, weekly, all time (likes depreciate in value over time)

When a user clicks on a coffee shop they're interested in, the business profile card pops up

A user will be given directions to the coffee shop of their choosing (stretch goal)

A user will select the radius of their search by selecting the distance in miles from a drop down menu (stretch).
