# [Coffee Shop Finder](https://matrix-coffee-shop-finder.herokuapp.com/)

## An app to find the 20 closest coffee shops utilizing google maps

### No installation required

This app was a collaborative project through GA. The user just needs to input their zip code and the map below will update to their location and list the 20 closest shops to them. The AJAX request looks for the keyword cafe, so users are given all the shops listed under that category, which occasionally has nothing to do with coffee. The user is also given a message if the shop is currently open and the address.

## Tech:
* MEAN stack
* Google Maps API
* Google Places library
* Heroku
* HTML
* CSS

## For the future
I would like to get an api key for everyone's use and hash it, it was a little complicated because it appears in the HTML file and I had a hard time finding a solution given the time constraints. * Update: after a ton of research, I found out that there is a difference between browser API keys and server side. I set restrictions on where the key could be used. I would like to do a lot more with the CSS as well.
